# SAMS 2013 -- Cyber Security Class

**Cyber Security: Do you take the red pill or the blue pill?**

In this project oriented class we take a hands-on approach to learning how
hackers "hack" into systems, and then how to defend against attacks.  Topics
covered include password cracking, infecting machines with viruses,
eavesdropping on network communication, and hiding data.  Of course we also
go through how to defend passwords by salting them, how to detect viruses with
signatures, how to secure communications over a network, and how to detect
hidden data.  The class culminates in a fun two team competition.
